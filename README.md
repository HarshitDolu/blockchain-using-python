# blockchain-using-python

I am a blockchain enthusiast.
I have created a blockchain using python.
I have used postman and flask to display the chain.

next I have added transactions in blockchain and have created decentralised system of a network having three nodes
and added cryptocurrency named -hadcoin(my own currency).
this will provide great visualization of blockchain terminologies like: mining,timestamp,transactions.

I have installed requests==2.18.4
used urlparser, uuid4 to create node address and used json files to post the request
